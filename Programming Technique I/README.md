> <b>Reflection</b><br/>
In reflecting on programming techniques, I've have learned how important it is to take structured and efficient approaches. Breaking down complex problems into manageable tasks and modular programming have improved the readability and reusability of code. Next, prioritizing code efficiency and optimization also  contributes to better performance and maintainability. I also think that working with others has exposed me to different programming styles and taught me the importance of writing code that is understandable to other developers. And finally, realizing that you need to constantly educate yourself in the dynamic field of programming is crucial to staying competitive and having a fulfilling programming experience.
