<br/>
## TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS [:pushpin:](https://github.com/nawwarahauni/Year1_Sem1/tree/main/Technology%20%26%20Information%20Systems)
This course has introduced me to the various aspects of information systems and technologies, which include hardware, software, networks and databases. I also gained hands-on experience in dissambling and installing PC through practical lab. The best part of this course is attending various lectures and industry visits that show us the real working environment and give us valuable insights that we can applied.
<br/>
<br/>
## PROGRAMMING TECHNIQUE [:pushpin:](https://github.com/nawwarahauni/Year1_Sem1/tree/main/Programming%20Technique%20I)
This course taught me how to programme in the C++ programming language, which is really interesting because I have never programmed in C++ before. I also had the opportunity to enhance and sharpen my problem-solving skills through assignments and lab exercises.
<br/>
<br/>
## DIGITAL LOGIC [:pushpin:](https://github.com/nawwarahauni/Year1_Sem1/tree/main/Digital%20Logic)
This course cover important topics such as components and tools for machines, learning concepts and theories like logic gates, and designing circuits. I also get hands-on experience in the lab where I get to interact with the simulator software and the equipment that are discussed in the class.
<br/>
<br/>
## DISCRETE STRUCTURE [:pushpin:](https://github.com/nawwarahauni/Year1_Sem1/tree/main/Discrete%20Structure)
This course taught the fundamentals of mathematical structures that are used in computer science. Through this course, I have gained a better understanding of how to analyze and solve problems using mathematical reasoning such as set theory, recurrence relations and graph theory.
