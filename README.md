# SEMESTER 1
Welcome to my semester 1 journey in UTM! :smile: In this semester, I am taking four core courses which is essential in my degree programme. These courses are designed to provide me with a strong foundation in my field of study, and equip me with the necessary skills and knowledge to succeed in my future career. Feel free to click on the course titles below to explore more details about each course. I'm excited to share my learning experiences and insights with you! :stars:

<br/>
## [TECHNOLOGY & INFORMATION SYSTEMS](https://github.com/nawwarahauni/Year1_Sem1/tree/main/Technology%20%26%20Information%20Systems)
This course has introduced me to the various aspects of information systems and technologies, which include hardware, software, networks and databases. I also gained hands-on experience in disassembling and installing PC through practical lab. The best part of this course is attending various lectures and industry visits that show us the real working environment and give us valuable insights that we can applied.
<br/>
<br/>
## [PROGRAMMING TECHNIQUE I](https://github.com/nawwarahauni/Year1_Sem1/tree/main/Programming%20Technique%20I)
This course not only introduced me to the syntax and structure of C++ but also allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in practical scenarios. The hands-on experience with coding through various assignments and lab exercises expanded my technical proficiency and also fostered a deeper understanding of algorithmic thinking and logical problem-solving strategies.
<br/>
<br/>
## [DIGITAL LOGIC](https://github.com/nawwarahauni/Year1_Sem1/tree/main/Digital%20Logic)
This course cover important topics such as components and tools for machines, learning concepts and theories like logic gates, and designing circuits. I also get hands-on experience in the lab where I get to interact with the simulator software and the equipment that are discussed in the class.
<br/>
<br/>
## [DISCRETE STRUCTURE](https://github.com/nawwarahauni/Year1_Sem1/tree/main/Discrete%20Structure)
This course taught the fundamentals of mathematical structures that are used in computer science. Through this course, I have gained a better understanding of how to analyze and solve problems using mathematical reasoning such as set theory, recurrence relations and graph theory.
