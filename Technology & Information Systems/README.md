  > <b>Reflection</b> <br/> By crafting this poster, I got the opportunity to express my creativity and share my message with others. I found posters are a powerful tool for communication, allowing me to convey important information that I got in these talks in a visually appealing way. As I worked on this poster, I also considered the audience I was targeting and the message I wanted to convey. <br/>
